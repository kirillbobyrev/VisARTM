# VisARTM

VisARTM is intended to become a successor of
[tm_navigator](https://github.com/omtcyf0/tm_navigator), a tool for visualizing
and assessing Topic Models primarily built using
[BigARTM](https://github.com/bigartm/bigartm) - fast and scalable library
for Topic Modelling.


## Installation and setup

VisARTM uses Python 3. While VisARTM is likely to work with Python 2, it is not
guaranteed.

`pip install -r requirements.txt` before using VisARTM. VisARTM requiers fairly
recent `flask` and `flask_sqlalchemy`.
